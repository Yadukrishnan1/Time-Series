A Difference-In-Difference (DID) model is used to estimate the promotional lift during a campaing for a retailer

A common problem in the retail space is the measurement of 'lift' from promotional campaigns. 'Lift' means the proportionate number of additional units sold during a promotion as compared to a baseline number of units. The lift will be measured via a counterfactual model. The objective is to build a model for the provided data, from this model, we derive an overall lift estimate for the promotions.
